## About Angor

<p align="justify">
Angor is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the robust foundations of Bitcoin, enhanced by the Nostr protocol for added security and transparency. It enables investors to maintain control over their funds throughout the investment process. Angor utilizes innovative time-lock contracts to release funds in stages, based on project milestones, allowing investors the flexibility to recover any unspent funds at any time. This mechanism ensures that the interests of investors and project founders are aligned, fostering a trust-minimized environment. Additionally, the integration of Nostr provides a platform for direct and uncensored communication between investors and founders, further enhancing the transparency and accountability of the crowdfunding process. Angor represents a new era of crowdfunding, where the power of Bitcoin and the transparency of Nostr converge to empower investors and facilitate founders in achieving their project goals efficiently and securely.
